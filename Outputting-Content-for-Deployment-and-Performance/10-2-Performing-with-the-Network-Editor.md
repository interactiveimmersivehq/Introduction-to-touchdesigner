### *10.2 Performing with the Network Editor*

Every situation is different, and it is possible that programming might have to be done during a live performance. If that is the case, there are a few things that can help manage the impact the Network Editor has on the system. The first is to turn off the viewers on any Operators that don't need to be monitored. See the diagrams below:

The next thing that helps is to only use 1 pane in the Network Editor. The more panes that are visible, the more things there are needing to be rendered. 

Finally, moving in and out of large Networks should be avoided. Moving in and out of large Networks can cause frame drops, as TouchDesigner will have to render all of the Operators in that Network before they can be viewed.
