This section will revolve around materials that are outside of the book itself. In the 'Projects' folder, there are two subfolders - 'Beginner' and 'Advanced'. Each will house a series of tutorials that include project files and videos. 

Some of these projects will be technical in nature, some will be artistic, but all of them will try to highlight a concept or common task.

The videos will start from a blank slate and build the project to completion, highlighting the problem solving approaches taken to complete the project.
